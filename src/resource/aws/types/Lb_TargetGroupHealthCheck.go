	   The HTTP or gRPC codes to use when checking for a successful response from a target.
	   The `health_check.protocol` must be one of `HTTP` or `HTTPS` or the `target_type` must be `lambda`.
	   Values can be comma-separated individual values (e.g., "200,202") or a range of values (e.g., "200-299").
	   - For gRPC-based target groups (i.e., the `protocol` is one of `HTTP` or `HTTPS` and the `protocol_version` is `GRPC`), values can be between `0` and `99`. The default is `12`.
	   - When used with an Application Load Balancer (i.e., the `protocol` is one of `HTTP` or `HTTPS` and the `protocol_version` is not `GRPC`), values can be between `200` and `499`. The default is `200`.
	   - When used with a Network Load Balancer (i.e., the `protocol` is one of `TCP`, `TCP_UDP`, `UDP`, or `TLS`), values can be between `200` and `599`. The default is `200-399`.
	   - When the `target_type` is `lambda`, values can be between `200` and `499`. The default is `200`.
